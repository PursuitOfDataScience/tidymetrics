Example metric Rmd used for unit tests.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)

# find flight delays by week, month, and quarter
flight_summary <- flights %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(ISOdate(year, month, day))) %>%
  cross_by_dimensions(origin, carrier) %>%
  cross_by_periods() %>%
  summarize(nb_flights = n(),
            avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
